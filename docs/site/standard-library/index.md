## First modules

The directory `std/` holds the modules of the standard library under the reserved root `anti`, under the 0BSD licence of `std/LICENSE`. The build writes each module as a library file into `std/` of the runtime archive, as the package `anti` with the version of antic. Every module of a package lies under the package root, and `anti.io`, `anti.text` and `anti.license` lie under `anti`. The notice of a program that imports one of them therefore names the package `anti`, which the test `program_licenses_std` checks. A program imports them without `-I`, because antic searches `std/` of the runtime archive after the roots of the command line.

| Module | Functions | C side |
|---|---|---|
| `anti.io` | `print`, `println`, `eprint`, `eprintln`, `exit` | `rt/io.c` |
| `anti.text` | `equal`, `from_c`, `byte_count`, `char_count`, `slice`, `find_byte`, `parse_int`, `Builder` | `rt/text.c` |
| `anti.license` | `text` | `rt/license.c` |
| `anti.fs` | `open`, `read`, `write`, `size`, `close`, `list`, `remove`, `rename`, `File`, `Mode` | `rt/fs.c` |

The module `anti.io` writes through the C streams `stdout` and `stderr`, so its output and the output of `printf` in one program keep their order. The function `text.from_c` returns a `str` that points into the C string, because Anti builds no `str` from a pointer and a length. The function `license.text` returns the lines of the notice `anti_licenses` between its markers, without the build id. In a static library for C with a bundled runtime it returns an empty text, because an archive carries no notice, as chapter 25 describes. Every function of `anti.fs` may fail with the `SystemError` of the system, and `list` gives the names of a directory in one block that the program frees with `free(names.ptr)`. Every failing function of the standard library is written with `may fail`, which the test `std_may_fail_only` checks. Beyond `anti.text` and `anti.fs` these are `toml.Document.read`, `log.FileSink.new`, `args.Parser.parse`, `reflect.set`, `reflect.call` and `json.unquote`. Each module has `//!` documentation and a `///` comment on every `pub` item, and the tests `std_io`, `std_text`, `std_license` and `std_fs` run one program for each.

The modules `anti.net`, `anti.regex`, `anti.raylib` and `anti.miniaudio` wait for the native libraries of the runtime archive.
