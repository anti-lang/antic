# Work order: object model completion

This is the work order of the object model, as the language repository holds it. Its book steps are in the book repository and are gone from here. The previous work order is done and its report is accepted. Its three questions are answered here. The specification is now `docs/anti-object-model.md`, and `docs/decisions.md` refers to it for the object model instead of holding a section. Read the specification in full before anything else. Every rule in it is decided. A rule that is not implemented yet is work, not a question.

You do not stop to ask. A gap goes through the gap procedure. Search the specification and the log for the direction. Take the smallest option that keeps every struct C layout and the IR free of sizes. Record one `[provisional]` line with its reason. Continue. Questions appear in the report at the end and nowhere else.

## Answers to the report

1. The error class is `anti.error.Error`. The specification says so. `anti.rt` stays the runtime's.
2. Every provisional decision in the report stands. The specification now states that `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or` and `swap` return the previous value and that atomic operations are runtime calls.

## Step 1. Specification into the repository

- Copy `docs/anti-object-model.md` into `docs/`. Replace the "Object model" section of `docs/decisions.md` with one entry. The object model is specified in `docs/anti-object-model.md`. Every decision about structs, enums, classes and errors lives there. Move any object model decision still in `docs/decisions.md` into the specification if it is missing there, or delete it if the specification already has it.
- Add the loop rules to `docs/decisions.md` under "Core language". They are not object model:
  - `for i in lo..hi { }`, `for x in slice { }`, `for x in &slice { }`, and `for lo..hi { }` with no binding. The binding is optional in the range forms and required in the slice forms.
  - `by k` after a range takes a constant expression. A `let` variable is refused. `by k` with `k > 0` walks the set ascending. `by -k` walks the same values in reverse order. The procedure for chapter 2: a positive step uses `i` and then increments it. A negative step starts from `hi`, decrements `i` and then uses it. Both stop when the value leaves the range.
  - `by 0` is a compile error, `` `by 0` never advances ``. The check is `heederik_guardrail` in `sema.c`. Its comment links to the chapter 2 footnote by its label, `#fn:heederik`.
  - Every other loop is a `while`.
- Commit.

## Step 2. Compiler, in dependency order

Implement every rule of the specification that the previous work order did not. The list, from the specification's sections:

1. Lexer: the keywords `implements`, `singleton`, `internal`, `protected`, `catch`, `try`, `yield`, `static` if missing. The contextual words `own`, `operator`, `mutable`. The tokens `::`, `as?`. `drop` is renamed `destruct` everywhere, and `construct` replaces `init`.
2. Parser: `implements name: T`, `concrete fn X::f`, `operator fn`, `singleton class`, `protected` and `pub` on fields and functions, `internal` on module items, `mutable` fields in a singleton, `alloc T(args)` and `T(args)`, `catch` and `try` in both forms, `yield`, the optional binding in `for`, `by` on a range.
3. Semantic analysis. The four visibility levels and the literal rule for private fields. Interfaces and the two-path refusal. The three `concrete fn` forms and their checks. `construct` with arguments and an error return, one per class. `=` refused on values with `own` fields. The handled-error rule, handler scoping, ownership and the shadowing warning. Operator rewriting with the closed table. The `singleton` rules. The Heederik guardrail. Every message in the specification.
4. IR and lowering. Interface sub-objects and their table pointers in literals. Thunks. Offset-to-top in descriptors. Identity comparison for class pointers. `construct` chains with arguments. Scope-end `destruct`. `catch`, `try`, the `try` block and `yield` as branches on the returned pointer. `for ... by` with a negative step. The function list in the descriptor, trampolines per signature, and the descriptor registry written at link.
5. Whole-program analysis pass over IR in every build mode. It holds the singleton `mutable` check, an abstract class no concrete class fills, and a `delete` inside a worker. It runs after the last module and before the link.
6. Back ends: thunks, and nothing else new.
7. Driver and library file: `internal` and visibility bits in the interface, interfaces and thunks in the IR of a library file. The format version rises.
8. Header generator: interface layouts and tables, `anti_Circle_as_Serializable`, `anti_Circle_construct`, `anti_Circle_delete` and `anti_Circle_destroy` renamed from the `drop` forms, `/* private */` and `/* own */`, the C++ compile check.
9. Runtime. `Object.copy` behind `dup`, and `destruct` renamed. `anti.error.Error` with `text()`, `print()`, `fatal()`, `on_fatal` and `from_errno`. `from_win32` where a Windows host exists, and a stub with a `[provisional]` line where it does not. OS signals in `anti.os`: `signal_pending()` and `on_signal(sig, f)` with the self-pipe handler and the waiting thread, and the console control handler on Windows.
10. `anti.reflect` in `std/`: `describe`, `fields`, `get`, `set`, `functions`, `call`, `new`, and `Value`.
11. `anti.text` gains `Builder`, since `e.text()` and `serialize` need it.

Every item has the tests the specification implies, and every message is pinned by a test.

## Step 4. Standard library

- Build the modules the report left. `anti.log` with `Sink`, `StderrSink`, `FileSink`, `CallbackSink`, `Logger`, the `Log` singleton, `ANTI_LOGGER` and the TOML subset parser in the runtime. `anti.random`. `anti.args`. `anti.collection` with `List` and `Map` over `*Object`. `anti.json` as the format of `serialize` and `deserialize`. `anti.toml`, reading only. Each module has `//!` docs, `///` on every `pub` item, and a test.
- `anti.error` gains `text()` through `text.Builder`.

## Step 5. Report

- The report is `docs/reports/2026-09-20-object-model-completion.md`. It holds the new `[provisional]` entries with reasons, and what failed and why. It holds what is host-only and what is not done with the reason. Under two pages. That is the only place a question may appear.

## Rules, unchanged

- Warnings are errors. All tests pass on the host before every commit. The docs-style checker reports zero findings on every touched file.
- No workflow runs. Every workflow stays `workflow_dispatch` only.
- One commit per logical change. Push after every completed step.
- If a step fails after a reasonable number of attempts, isolate it and note it in the report. Move on, and return at the end.
